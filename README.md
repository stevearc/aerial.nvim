## Setup

Aerial can display document symbols from a couple of sources; you will need to
follow the setup steps for at least one of them. You can configure your
preferred source(s) with the `backends` option (see [Options](#options)). The
default is to prefer LSP when it's available and fall back to Treesitter.

### LSP

First ensure you have a functioning LSP setup (see
[nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)). Once complete, add
the aerial `on_attach` callback to your config:

```lua
-- Set up your LSP clients here, using the aerial on_attach method
require("lspconfig").vimls.setup{
  on_attach = require("aerial").on_attach,
}
-- Repeat this for each language server you have configured
```

If you have your own custom `on_attach` function, call aerial's `on_attach` from
inside it:

```lua
local function my_custom_attach(client, bufnr)
  -- your code here
  require("aerial").on_attach(client, bufnr)
end
```

### Treesitter

**The treesitter backend is in Beta status**

Please do try it out, and file an issue if you encounter any problems.

First ensure you have
[nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) installed
and configured for all languages you want to support. That's all! Aerial will
automatically fetch symbols from treesitter.

<details>
  <summary>Supported languages</summary>

it](https://github.com/stevearc/aerial.nvim/issues/new?assignees=stevearc&labels=enhancement&template=feature-request--treesitter-language-.md&title=)

</details>

### Markdown

There is a simple custom backend that does rudimentary parsing of markdown
headers. It should work well enough in most cases, but does not parse the full
markdown spec.

There is now an experimental [treesitter parser for
markdown](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/issues/872), so you
can install that and try the treesitter backend instead.

### Keymaps

While not required, you may want to add some keymaps for aerial. The best way to
do this is with the `on_attach` option:

```lua
require("aerial").setup({
  on_attach = function(bufnr)
    -- Toggle the aerial window with <leader>a
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(bufnr, 'n', '<leader>a', '<cmd>AerialToggle!<CR>', {})
    -- Jump forwards/backwards with '{' and '}'
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(bufnr, 'n', '{', '<cmd>AerialPrev<CR>', {})
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(bufnr, 'n', '}', '<cmd>AerialNext<CR>', {})
    -- Jump up the tree with '[[' or ']]'
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(bufnr, 'n', '[[', '<cmd>AerialPrevUp<CR>', {})
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(bufnr, 'n', ']]', '<cmd>AerialNextUp<CR>', {})
  end
})
```

All possible SymbolKind values can be found [in the LSP
spec](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-17/#symbolKind).
These are the values used for configuring icons, highlight groups, and
filtering.

## Default Keybindings

The default keybindings in the aerial window. You can add your own in
`ftplugin/aerial.vim`, and remove these by setting `default_bindings = false`.

| Key       | Command                                                        |

| `p`       | Scroll to the symbol (stay in aerial buffer)                   |
| `<C-j>`   | Go down one line and scroll to that symbol                     |

| `H`/`zC`  | Recursive collapse the symbol under the cursor                 |
| `zR`      | Expand all nodes in the tree                                   |

## Third-party integrations

### Telescope

If you have [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
installed, there is an extension for fuzzy finding and jumping to symbols. It
functions similarly to the builtin `lsp_document_symbols` picker, the main
difference being that it uses the aerial backend for the source (e.g. LSP,
treesitter, etc) and that it filters out some symbols (see the `filter_kind`
option).

You can activate the picker with `:Telescope aerial`

If you want the command to autocomplete, you can load the extension first:

```lua
require('telescope').load_extension('aerial')
```

### fzf

If you have [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) installed you can trigger
fuzzy finding with `:call aerial#fzf()`. To create a mapping:

```vim
nmap <silent> <leader>ds <cmd>call aerial#fzf()<cr>
```

### Lualine

There is a lualine component to display the symbols for your current cursor
position

```lua
require("lualine").setup({
  sections = {
    lualine_x = { "aerial" },

    -- Or you can customize it
    lualine_y = { "aerial",
      -- The separator to be used to separate symbols in status line.
      sep = ' ) ',

      -- The number of symbols to render top-down. In order to render only 'N' last
      -- symbols, negative numbers may be supplied. For instance, 'depth = -1' can
      -- be used in order to render only current symbol.
      depth = nil,

      -- When 'dense' mode is on, icons are not rendered near their symbols. Only
      -- a single icon that represents the kind of current symbol is rendered at
      -- the beginning of status line.
      dense = false,

      -- The separator to be used to separate symbols in dense mode.
      dense_sep = '.',
    },
  },
})
```

## Highlight

There are highlight groups created for each `SymbolKind`. There will be one for
the name of the symbol (`Aerial<SymbolKind>`, and one for the icon
(`Aerial<SymbolKind>Icon`). For example:

```vim
hi link AerialClass Type
hi link AerialClassIcon Special
hi link AerialFunction Special
hi AerialFunctionIcon guifg=#cb4b16 guibg=NONE guisp=NONE gui=NONE cterm=NONE

" There's also this group for the cursor position
hi link AerialLine QuickFixLine
```

## FAQ

**Q: I accidentally opened a file into the aerial window and it looks bad. How can I prevent this from happening?**

Try installing [stickybuf](https://github.com/stevearc/stickybuf.nvim). It was designed to prevent exactly this problem.
